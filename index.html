<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h3>What are my hobbies?<h3>
<p>Basically, I ain't a person who sticks to one single thing and keepsnit running for the rest of their life. I am a multitasker and I choose my boats carefully to keep each leg on a different boat.<p>
<br>
<p> I am very much passionate with cooking, making vlogs and reading. I don't know if trying to be a social media influencer is a hobby... I am pretty much a bathroom singer and a managable dancer. I would even say that I'm a true KatyCat, as I keep stalking Katy Perry, while listening to her (can be considered as a hobby :P). Lately, I have started to write songs and content too. Let's see how well everything goes.<p>
<br>
In order to share my life and my interests to the world, I started a YouTube Channel with the name <b><i> Perfectly Imperfect with Cherry</i></b>, which you should totally check out! Few videos are:<p>
